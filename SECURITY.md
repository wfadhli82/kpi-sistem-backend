# Security Guidelines

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Exposed Supabase Credentials
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue:** Supabase URL and API key were exposed in build files
- **Solution:** 
  - Regenerate Supabase API keys
  - Use environment variables only
  - Never commit real credentials to version control

### 2. Hardcoded Default Credentials
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue:** Default admin credentials were hardcoded in source code
- **Solution:**
  - Changed default email to `admin@maiwp.gov.my`
  - Changed default password to `ChangeMe123!`
  - Use environment variables for all credentials

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Never commit these files to version control
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.production.local
```

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Change default passwords immediately after deployment

### API Key Management
- Regenerate Supabase API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production
- Monitor API key usage in Supabase dashboard

### Database Security
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Regular security audits

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Use parameterized queries

### 2. Authentication
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure password hashing
- Enable multi-factor authentication if possible

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies

### 4. Monitoring
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Log security events
- Regular security assessments

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

1. **Regenerate Supabase API Keys** - Do this immediately
2. **Change Default Passwords** - Use strong passwords
3. **Update Environment Variables** - Set proper values in production
4. **Review Access Logs** - Check for unauthorized access
5. **Enable Security Monitoring** - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
